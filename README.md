# CryptoIOC

CryptoIOC is an IOC sharing platform with the goal of sharing IP/port pairs used to communicate with cryptomining pools.

Why? because an increasing number of malware programs install stealthy cryptominers on infected systems. Although
communication to cryptomining pools is usually legitimate, it is also an indicator of compromise. The published IOCs can
be used to monitor and detect network connections to cryptomining pools.

The CryptoIOC website is running at the following URL: https://cryptoioc.ch/
